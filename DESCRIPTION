Description: Datasets are collected here for differentially (up- and down-)
        expressed proteins identified in proteomic studies of cancer and cell
        culture experiments. All datasets use UniProt IDs, which have been added
        if not present in the original publications. Tables of amino acid
        compositions of proteins are included for functions to compute chemical
        compositions using basis species and thermodynamic potentials for
        proteomic transformations.
