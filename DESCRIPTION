Description: Datasets are collected here for differentially (up- and down-)
        expressed proteins in cancer. All datasets use UniProt IDs, which have been
        added if not present in the original publications. Tables of amino acid
        compositions of proteins are provided, and the functions are geared toward the
        exploration of chemical compositional differences and thermodynamic
        descriptions using basis species.
