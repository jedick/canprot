Description: Chemical analysis of differentially expressed proteins in cancer
  and cell culture proteomics experiments. The data include lists of up- and
  down-regulated proteins in different cancer types (breast, colorectal, liver,
  lung, pancreatic, prostate) and laboratory conditions (hypoxia, hyperosmotic
  stress, high glucose, 3D cell culture, and proteins secreted in hypoxia),
  together with amino acid compositions for proteins obtained from UniProt.
  Functions are provided to calculate chemical parameters including protein
  length, carbon oxidation state, and stoichiometric hydration state. In
  addition, phylostrata (evolutionary ages) of protein-coding human genes are
  compiled using data from Liebeskind et al. (2016) <doi:10.1093/gbe/evw113> and
  Trigos et al. (2017) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1617743114>. The maximum activity
  analysis described in Dick (2021) <doi:10.1101/2021.01.29.428804> is
  implemented to compute optimal values of oxygen fugacity and water activity.
  The vignettes contain plots of chemical and phylostrata differences and
  references for all datasets.
