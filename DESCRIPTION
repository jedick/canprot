Description: Chemical analysis of proteins based on their amino acid
  composition. Amino acid compositions can be read from FASTA files and used to
  calculate chemical metrics including carbon oxidation state and stoichiometric
  hydration state, as described in [Dick et al.
  (2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6145-2020). Other properties that can be
  calculated are protein length, grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY),
  isoelectric point (pI), and molecular weight (MW). A database of amino acid
  compositions of human proteins derived from UniProt is provided.
