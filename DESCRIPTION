Description: Datasets are collected here for differentially (up- and down-)
        expressed proteins identified in proteomic studies of cancer and in cell
        culture experiments. Tables of amino acid compositions of proteins are
        used for calculations of chemical composition, projected into selected
        basis species. Plotting functions are used to visualize the compositional
        differences and thermodynamic potentials for proteomic transformations.
