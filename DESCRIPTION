Description: Chemical analysis of differentially expressed proteins in cancer
  and cell culture proteomics experiments. The data include >250 published lists
  of up- and down-regulated proteins in different cancer types (breast,
  colorectal, liver, lung, pancreatic, prostate) and laboratory conditions
  (hypoxia, hyperosmotic stress, high glucose, 3D cell culture, and proteins
  secreted in hypoxia), together with amino acid compositions for proteins
  obtained from UniProt. Functions are provided to calculate chemical parameters
  including protein length, carbon oxidation state, and stoichiometric hydration
  state. In addition, phylostrata (evolutionary ages) of protein-coding human
  genes are compiled from data of Liebeskind et al. (2016) <doi:10.1093/gbe/evw113>
  and Trigos et al. (2017) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1617743114>. The vignettes contain
  plots of chemical and phylostrata differences and references for all datasets.
