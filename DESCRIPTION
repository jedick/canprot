Description: Chemical analysis of differentially expressed proteins in cancer
  and cell culture proteomics experiments. The data files are derived from >250
  published lists of up- and down-regulated proteins in different cancer types
  (breast, colorectal, liver, lung, pancreatic, prostate) and laboratory
  experiments (hypoxia, hyperosmotic stress, high glucose, 3D cell culture, and
  proteins secreted in hypoxia), together with amino acid compositions for
  proteins obtained from UniProt. Functions are provided to calculate chemical
  metrics such as protein length, carbon oxidation state, and stoichiometric
  hydration state following methods described by Dick et al. (2020)
  <doi:10.5194/bg-17-6145-2020>. The vignettes have plots of differences of
  chemical metrics between up- and down-regulated proteins and literature
  references for all datasets.
