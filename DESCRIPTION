Description: Compositional analysis of differentially expressed proteins in
  cancer and cell culture proteomics experiments. The data include lists of up-
  and down-expressed proteins in different types of cancer (colorectal,
  pancreatic) and laboratory conditions (hypoxia, hyperosmotic stress), together
  with amino acid compositions obtained from protein sequences on UniProt.
  Functions are provided to compute compositional metrics including protein
  length, carbon oxidation state, and stoichiometric hydration state. In
  addition, phylostrata (ages) of protein-coding genes are available using data
  from Liebeskind et al. (2016) <doi:10.1093/gbe/evw113> or Trigos et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.1073/pnas.1617743114>. Plots of the differences in the chemical
  compositions and phylostrata for each cancer type and experimental condition
  are shown in the vignettes.
