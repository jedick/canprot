Description: Compositional analysis of differentially expressed proteins in
  cancer and cell culture proteomics experiments. The data include lists of up-
  and down-regulated proteins in different types of cancer (colorectal,
  pancreatic, breast, lung, prostate) and laboratory conditions (hypoxia,
  hyperosmotic stress, 3D cell culture, and proteins secreted in hypoxia),
  together with amino acid compositions calculated for protein sequences from
  UniProt. Functions are provided to compute compositional metrics including
  protein length, carbon oxidation state, and stoichiometric hydration state. In
  addition, phylostrata (evolutionary ages) of protein-coding genes are available
  using data from Liebeskind et al. (2016) <doi:10.1093/gbe/evw113> or Trigos et
  al. (2017) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1617743114>. The vignettes show references and
  plots of differences of chemical composition and phylostrata for all datasets.
