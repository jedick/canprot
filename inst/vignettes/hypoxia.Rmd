This vignette from the R package [canprot](https://github.com/jedick/canprot) version `r packageDescription("canprot")$Version` shows compositional metrics and phylostrata for proteins that are differentially expressed in hypoxia compared to control conditions.
Abbreviations:

  * <i>Z</i><sub>C</sub> &ndash; carbon oxidation state; <i>n</i><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> &ndash; stoichiometric hydration state per residue ([<span title="Distinct trends in chemical composition of proteins from metagenomes in redox and salinity gradients">Dick et al., 2020</span>](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.020008); [<span title="Water as a reactant in the differential expression of proteins in cancer">Dick, 2020</a>](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.035022)).
  * PS &ndash; phylostratum; <i>n</i><sub>AA</sub> &ndash; protein length; MW &ndash; molecular weight per residue.

Gene ages, expressed as phylostratum numbers, are taken from [<span title="Altered interactions between unicellular and multicellular genes drive hallmarks of transformation in a diverse range of solid tumors">Trigos et al., 2017</span>](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1617743114) (TPPG17) or [<span title="Towards consensus gene ages ">Liebeskind et al, 2016</span>](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evw113) (LMM16).

```{r datasets}
datasets <- pdat_hypoxia(2020)
```

```{r comptab, results="hide", message=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
pdat1 <- lapply(datasets, pdat_hypoxia)
comptab1 <- lapply(pdat1, get_comptab)
comptab2 <- lapply(pdat1, get_comptab, "PS_TPPG17", "PS_LMM16")
comptab3 <- lapply(pdat1, get_comptab, "nAA", "MW")
```

Differences are calculated as (median value for up-regulated proteins) - (median value for down-regulated proteins), except for phylostrata, where mean values are used.
Dashed lines enclose the 50% credible region for highest probability density.

```{r diffplot, fig.width=9, fig.height=8, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE, pngquant = pngquant}
layout(matrix(c(0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3), nrow = 2))

diffplot(comptab1, labtext = NA)
diffplot(comptab2, c("PS_TPPG17", "PS_LMM16"))
diffplot(comptab3, c("nAA", "MW"), labtext = NA)
```

In the table, values of &Delta;<i>Z</i><sub>C</sub> and &Delta;<i>n</i><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> are multiplied by 1000, values of &Delta;PS and &Delta;MW are multiplied by 100, and negative values are shown in bold.
Abbreviations:

  * _n_~down~ &ndash; number of down-regulated proteins; _n_~up~ &ndash; number of up-regulated proteins; Hx48 &ndash; hypoxia 48 h; Hx72 &ndash; hypoxia 72 h; -S &ndash; supernatant fraction; -P &ndash; pellet fraction; DMSO &ndash; dimethyl sulfoxide; NO.sul &ndash; nitric oxide-donating sulindac; sul &ndash; sulindac; 4Gy &ndash; radiation; POS &ndash; primay origin canine osteosarcoma (OS) cells; HMPOS &ndash; metastatic origin canine OS cells.
